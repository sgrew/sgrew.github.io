// Your computer scientist of the day is Alan Turing
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing
// He is the founder of theoretical computer science and inventor of
// the Turing machine, Turing test, Turing-completeness and many other
// significant contributions. He was instrumental in the cryptanalysis
// of the Engima ciphering system used by the Nazi Germany. This 
// effort was adapted for the film "Imitation Game".
