# CPSC 120 - Lab 1
In this lab we will be exploring several foundational topics in computer programming. The lab exercise assumes you are comfortable using `git`, `g++`, and the BASH shell. Refer back to the previous lab if you need a reminder on how these different tools work.

Each directory contains a laboratory exercise with an additional `README.md` which describes that individual exercise. Please complete each exercise in order before attempting the next exercise.

## Objective
* Understand how to use std::cout to print useful information to the console
* How to declare variables
* How to assign variables
* Understand the difference between hardcoding and softcoding values
* Variable typing such as int and float
* Introduction to basic operators operators
* Understand how to use std::cin to request user input to affect a program's output
* Using if-else constructs and testing for equivalence/equality

# Instructions
Write a program for each exercise sub-directory. Each exercise subdirectory is prefixed with the string `prob`.

Ask questions early on and feel free to work with your classmates. Remember you want to turn in your own work so please do not copy and paste between your peers.

The instrutor and the lab assistant want to help you and all you need to do is ask them for help.

# Rubric
Each exercise is worth 5 points. There is a total of 15 points possible. Your program must compile, in other words be syntactically correct, before it is graded. Submissions that do not compile shall be assigned a zero grade. 

For each problem:
* Functionality (3 points): Your submission shall be assessed for the appropriate constructs and strategies to address the exercise.

* Compilation (1 point): Your submission shall compile with no warnings. Compile with errors results in a zero grade.

* Readability (1 point): Your submission shall be assessed by checking whether your code passess the style and format check, as well as how well it follows the proper naming conventions, and internal documentation guidelines.
